        Importance of emotional Intelligence in life</h1>
    <p class="para">

        Emotional intelligence plays a vital role in shaping a fulfilling life.
        It helps us understand and manage our own emotions, while also recognizing and responding to the feelings of
        others.
        This leads to stronger relationships, better communication, and more thoughtful decision-making.
        People with high emotional intelligence tend to handle stress more effectively, show greater empathy,
        and navigate social situations with ease.
        In both personal and professional settings, itâ€™s a key ingredient for resilience, leadership, and overall
        well-being.
